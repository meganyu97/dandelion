i wonder where all the little parachutes
from wishes i've made on dandelions have landed
sometimes i wish i could open the memories from my past
and see where they are now
to see what's become of them 
and how they're holding up

i wish to live like a dandelion
take me back to adolescent days
where my innocent hands
would grip onto the stems for dear life
hoping that one of its seeds
would fly, far far away
and someone would hear my wishes 
i'd like to imagine the soldiers of one of my wishes 
turned into hope for another child in paris
or an exhausted father walking home in nanjing
and whenever i whisk away the seedling parachutes of another
i say a silent prayer that all its wishes past come to fruition.
